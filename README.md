Part one and part two were simple as they are stateless and therefore can be just Functions

- In the FlipFlop we encounter a symbol that was not defined in the specification, but could be figured out with a simple google search
 - single input triangle with a ball being a NOT function
- "falling edge" would probably need to be checked that our intuitive understanding is correct: "goes from 1 to 0"
